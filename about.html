            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Bugema University Christian Union Fellowship (BUCU) is a student-based Pentecostal and non-denominational fellowship situated in Bugema University. The fellowship was started as a bible study group for born-again and Anglican students of Bugema University by Reverend Mukama Livingstone and Papa Solomon (RIP) in 2009. Rev Livingstone was the then Lay-Reader of St. Thomas Church of Uganda of Lukyamu-Bugema, Mpigi Parish as a small group in a classroom of the University and Papa Solomon was a student at Bugema University. The main aim of starting the bible study was to enable non-Adventist students of the University to also find fellowship and growth in their faith, while in the University. Together they laid the foundation of the fellowship in Bugema University.</p>
            <p>The study group rapidly grew from 3 members to 150 members within a short time. Unfortunately, 1 year after its birth i.e., in 2010, the international members decided to separate from the national members, sparking pain and sorrow among the small family that had just been raised as “infant fellowship” in Bugema University. Fortunately through sacrificial prayers by notable members, not forgetting the least known “STELLA”, they prayed for the unity of the fellowship and thus the team remained strong till to date, despite departure by the international members.</p>
            <p>Due to the rising membership, the fellowship was shifted to St. Thomas Church of Uganda where it was entrusted with the first English service and self-governance until March, 2021! The fellowship is student-led, headed by the chairperson who is elected from time to time. The main activities are under the watch of the Patron and Alumni board.</p>
            <p>In February 2021, following the posting instructions of Ordinand Brian Nkambwe where the fellowship was required to become part of St Thomas COU administration in significant parts of her activities, the leadership decided to turn down their order. This eventually led to extermination of the fellowship in March 2021, after several meetings, both with the church and the Parish leadership.</p>
            <p>The fellowship then shifted to rent the space with Barahi Estates at small gate, praying from a temporary structure built by the fellowship. This hostage went on until December 2023 when the landlord terminated contract with the fellowship as tenants to Barahi estates. However, the fellowship had acquired a plot near Seattle hostel in October 2023 from Mr. Kefa at 13 million shillings. The money was raised through 3 years fund raising and credit from Pr. Moses Sserugo.</p>
            <p>So, in December 26, the fellowship started their official construction in her own land and shifted to the own structure by first Sunday of 2024 (07/01/2024). And since then, rest has been by the sides of the fellowship till to date. Today the fellowship is guided by holistic constitution (2023), Executives and Elders board, and church committee members. It is also registered with the Uganda Registration Services Bureau (URSB) as BUCU Church Limited and is established in her own land opposite the small gate.</p>
            <p>Praise be to God for all the loving kindness He has shown to Bucu, in that He has led us this far. Thanks be to all the individuals who gave themselves for the good cause of the future of the gospel in Bugema University.</p>

                <li><strong>Pastor Joseph Kiptirui, of Jubilee Eagles Ministry and Now Outreach Missions Africa</strong> - He greatly expanded the outreach missions of BUCU, to near and far outreach mission programs, and his strong financial, administrative and mobilization support over time.</li>
